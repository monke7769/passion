    "Suppose Alice and Bob need to send an encrypted message between the two of them. To do this with a substitution cipher, they must agree on a CIPHERTEXT ALPHABET, which gives the translation of every character into another set one, such that the CIPHERTEXT ALPHABET has the same number of characters as the original set of characters you are encrypting, and such that no two elements of the CIPHERTEXT ALPHABET are the same. \n",

    "It's quite simple, though you might not be able to decrypt the encrypted string as easily, since there are 26! different substitution ciphers. But using modern computer tools, one can quite easily decode messages sent using substitution ciphers, so this essentially is rendered useless except as an easy-to-understand model and maybe to troll your teachers at school."
