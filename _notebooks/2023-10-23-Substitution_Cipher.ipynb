To do this with a substitution cipher, they must agree on a CIPHERTEXT ALPHABET, which gives the translation of every character into another set one, such that the CIPHERTEXT ALPHABET has the same number of characters as the original set of characters you are encrypting, and such that no two elements of the CIPHERTEXT ALPHABET are the same. \n",
