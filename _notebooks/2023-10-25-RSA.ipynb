    "Alice, the sender, will convert her message into a number m, using the ASCII alphabet, converting each character one by one. She then caluclates c, which is congruent to m^e, modulo n. This is the final encrypted message. If the message were to be sent over a connection, the only information an attacker would be able to glean would be this and the public key (originally made available to everyone).\n",

    "Bob receives the message c (ciphertext), and computes c^d modulo n to retreive the original message as a string of numbers, at which point he can convert back into letters using ASCII. \n",

Without it, anyone who intercepts the message will have a lot of brute forcing to do. Sophisticated computers can take upwards of days to crack a message sent with RSA. Very secure!"
